# CodSoft-Internship_Tasks

For CodSoft Internship I have created this repository and it contains my work done for this Internship.

Internship Domain: Machine Learning

For this CodSoft Internship in Machine Learning, I have choosed 3 Tasks for Internship Completion:
   1. Customer Churn Prediction
   2. Credit Card Fraud Detection
   3. SMS Spam Detection
      
For these Tasks, I have used datasets given by CodSoft Organization and I used Google Colab for Data-PreProcessing, Training Data, Visualization of Data and Predicting Results using Python libraries.

I have developed Websites for above Tasks and each Task folder in this repository contains,

   1. Google Colab link in text file(Enabled Access).
   2. DataSets used(Given by CodSoft).
   3. Website Folder.
      
For Website Development of all tasks these tools are used,

   1. Python libaries
   2. Django Framework
   3. HTML and CSS.
   4. PyCharm
      
Note: Data Set for Credit Card Fraud Detection is not uploaded as it is very large to upload in Repository.
